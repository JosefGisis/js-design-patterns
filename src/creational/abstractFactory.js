// The abstract factory pattern provides an interface for creating related or dependant objects
// without specifying their concrete classes. This allows the client to be separated from the
// specifics of the object conformities and dependencies.

// Example using es6 features.

// In this example we have a clothing factory that can create red or blue clothing.
// It is important that all clothing products need to be the same color. Rather than managing that
// in the client code, we can use an abstract factory to ensure that all products are the same color.
