## Design Patterns

This repository contains practice examples for all 23 design patterns from "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides in JavaScript. The examples are arranged as a React web page.

The examples will not use classes to utilize the benefits of JavaScript while emulating the functionality of the design patterns.

#### Design patterns are divided into three categories.

-   <h3>Creational</h3> the way objects are created.
-   <h3>Structural</h3> the way objects relate to each other.
-   <h3>Behavioral</h3> the way objects communicate with each other.

These categories can be further divided by class or object based designs, but because we are not using classes, there is no such distinction.
